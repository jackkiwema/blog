# Call Manager System Functionality
## Auto-Attendant/ Interactive Voice Response
Auto-Attendant offers a menu system that allows callers to be transferred to an extension without
going through a telephone operator or receptionist. The auto-attendant is also known as a digital
receptionist.

The IVR or auto-attendant provides a flow for your callers once the call is received for example
"press 1 for sales" or "press 2 for support". Allowing for skill based routing where the caller is
directed to the most capable person to handle their request.

Using our convenient web based interface, you can easily set up basic or more complex voice menu's
to help your callers to the right destination.

For a caller to find a user on a phone system, a dial-by-name directory is usually available. This
feature lists users by name, allowing the caller to press a key to automatically ring the extension of a
user once his/her extension is announced by the auto attendant.

## Automatic Call Distribution (ACD)
With ACD, employees (agents) log into a queue group so they can answer calls for a specific
department. Incoming calls are routed into the appropriate queue, and the calls are distributed to the
agents logged into that queue. ACD queuing is a critical business function, especially for call
centers, and needs to be as robust and feature-rich as possible to allow the maximum flexibility for
your company.

Many suppliers simply route calls to a list of names (a hunt group) and call it ACD queuing
leaving customers with incomplete and frustrating systems. IP Fusion offers the most
sophisticated ACD capability which offers a whole list of advanced features, such as:

![auto](../images/auto.png)

### Even load distribution
Fusion system queuing includes the ability to guarantee an even distribution of calls across all agents logged
into an ACD queue. We keep track of how long it has been since the agent last received a call, and
route the next call to the person who has been off the phone the longest time.

### Self-managed agent presence
Managing ACD queues can be complex and time consuming for administrators. With most systems, 
administrators must keep track of who is working, when employees go on breaks, when someone
comes in late, etc. IP Fusion queuing allows employees to log themselves in and out of queues, and
the system dynamically and automatically adjusts call routing appropriately. Administrators never
have to be involved in the process. Management can monitor queue and employee activity, in real
time, but they don’t have to re-configure the system with every employee change.

## Skills-based Routing
This feature allows administrators to rank employees in ACD queues by how skilled they are, or by
the priority the employees should have in answering calls.

You can set the rank of the most skilled agents to the highest level, and decrease the ranking for
those with lesser skills. When a call arrives, the IP Fusion call manager system knows which agents
are already assisting customers, and the incoming call is routed automatically to the highest-ranked
available agent. This ensures that the most skilled agents take the most calls. New employees in
training can be ranked at the lower levels, allowing them to help when the need is great but giving
them more time to learn from peers.

### Call waiting signal
Sometimes employees in queues can chat because the phone lines aren’t busy. IP Fusion signals all
queue members whenever there are callers waiting, so the agents know that they should wrap up
their current calls in a businesslike fashion so they can help the next caller. There’s never a case
where an employee doesn’t know people are waiting.

### Custom on-hold information
Fusion system gives you the option to play music from a broad selection of styles while callers wait, or
to play a custom informational or promotional message. The music and message can be different
from queue to queue and you get wide flexibility in when to use the recordings.

### Real time queue monitoring
Effective management of a call center often means knowing what is happening all the time. How
many callers are waiting? How long is the wait time? How many employees are actively answering
calls for each queue? These questions and more can be answered in real-time through our
sophisticated queue monitoring tools. Part of our management suite, these tools allow managers to 
see exactly what is happening with any agent. Whether employees are located in the same facility as
the manager or telecommute from remote/branch offices, management can monitor activity levels
and ensure that calls are being taken in an efficient manner.

By monitoring call activity, managers can move assets from one ACD queue to another as
needed, or know when they need to get extra help. Real-time queue monitoring will improve
your business response and efficiency.

### Agent wrap-up time
In a busy call center, agents often find their phones ringing as soon as they hang up from the
previous call. With IP Fusion Queue Wrap-up Time, queue administrators can give agents time to
finish details from the last call before the phone rings again. The amount of time can be
customized for each queue.

## Agent Web Interface
Fusion System agent module offers web browser agent screen that can be customized and controlled
using a powerful set of tools available within the call center software. An extremely sophisticated
Script Builder for creation of scripts with custom variables and embedded URL like any web
enabled CRM or web-sites. Custom disposition or wrap-up codes as well as custom DND codes
allow for detailed reporting of agent activity.

## Desktop Agent/Softphone
Fusion System uses java based a desktop client. It provides a full integration with the Call manager
from viewing extensions all the way through to a full queue interface. 

Our agent is very easy to use and provisions out in a flash with our server provisioning tools. The
desktop clients further provides a built in SIP client and XMPP integration. This allows users to chat,
transfer files, video call and video conference from their desktop.

The capabilities of each client user are based on administrator rights set during deployment

## Call Detail Records
Fusion System has a powerful and detailed call reporting platform which provides detailed reports on all
phone calls made within the system, this includes reports on all incoming calls, outgoing calls by
user, conference calls and user login reports. The reports can be customized to fit your specific
organizational needs. This report includes:

* the phone number of the subscriber originating the call (calling party)

* the starting time of the call (date and time)
* the call duration
* the identification of the telephone exchange or equipment writing the record

* Call hold duration

## Call Recording
Fusion System call recording functionality is able to continually record 100% of all calls or record ondemand. All calls are digitally recorded and capture and store for every agent and customer interaction regardless of the source, destination or service (ISDN, VoIP, and Mobile). Calls are recorded to a hard drives and can be instantly found, accessed and replayed.

## Music on hold & Music on transfer
While your customers are waiting, provide them some music. It's as easy as uploading an MP3 file
using the IP fusion web administration interface. You can upload as much files as you like, any time
a caller is put on hold, alone in a conference room or waiting in a call queue the music

## Predictive Dialer
Using a pre-loaded list of numbers, IP Fusion quickly and automatically places outbound calls
and connects the answered calls to available agents. IP Fusion monitors the call center volume
and time per call, intelligently adjusting its dial rate to minimize the time your agents spend
waiting between conversations.

Our predictive dialer also allows the dialing campaign manager to manually increase and
decrease the amount of inbound and outbound calls on the fly, optimizing call center
productivity every day.

The IP Fusion Predictive Dialer utilizes sophisticated algorithms to speed up and slow down the call
rate based on, number of available agents, number of available lines, the campaign's average call time
and other statistical information.

## Voicemail System
A complete voicemail system is integrated in the fusion call manager server. It includes multiple
delivery options for your voicemail messages: telephone access using a voice menu, automated email delivery with attachment or web based accessibility. You can also organize voicemail
messages in multiple folders for easy retrieval. Additionally, many IP phones will alert you
immediately when a new voicemail message arrives.

## Flexible Extension Logic
* Unified dial plan—any phone can dial any other phone by extension number, regardless of location
* An incoming call may simultaneously ring more than one telephone
* An incoming call may serially ring extensions to find an employee

## Conferencing
Conferencing has never been easier; thanks to IP fusion integrated Conference Bridge. You can
easily set up a conference with internal users, or invite external people to join your conference.
Our web based interface or * key on your telephone lets you easily control your conference. The
number of participants is only limited by the number of phone lines you have available

## Call Scheduler (Call Forwarding Based on Time and Day)
Call Scheduler allows you to pre-schedule call treatments based on time and dates parameters. When
a call comes in the system checks to see if call schedule parameters apply the call is then forwarded
either to an extension, voicemail box, recorded message or even to an external mobile number.

## Call Center Scripting

customers expect accurate, complete and personalized service.
